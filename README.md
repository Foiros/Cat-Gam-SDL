# Cat-Gam-SDL

Cat Game is my personal project that I have used to pass some courses and have kept on developing during my free time as a practice work. 
In this game, player takes the role of a mother cat, who needs to take care of her kitten while it grows. This is accomplished by gathering meat and water for the kitten and 
making sure that Wolfs donâ€™t bother it. The game is meant to be small scale strategy/resource management game. 

I have designed the game and done programming for it. And sad to say, but the art assets have also been done by me. While working on this project, 
I have mainly learned to use SDL2 to make games, C++ techniques and programming advanced things like A* pathfinding, FSM and some others. 
I think especially the A* and FSM are some of the best code I have written thus far, and yet I think there is so much more for me to learn still.
